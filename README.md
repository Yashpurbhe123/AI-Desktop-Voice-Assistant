# AI-Desktop-Voice-Assistant
AI Desktop Voice Assistants has transformed how we interact with computer. AI desktop voice assistant can understand human language voice commands and do primary desktop job. 


<br>In today’s era almost all tasks are digitalized. We have Smartphone in hands and it is nothing less than having world at your fingertips. These days we aren’t even using fingers. We just speak of the task and it is done. There exist systems where we can say Text Dad, “I’ll be late today.” And the text is sent. That is the task of an AI Voice Assistant. AI voice assistants are artificial intelligence software that allows us to interact with technology using natural language.</br>
<br>AI voice assistant is used to run machine like laptop or PC on your own command. AI voice assistant is an application program that understands natural language and voice commands to complete tasks for the users. They can perform a wide range of tasks, from answering questions opening application, searching information and many more. The Users can ask their assistants’ questions, control their laptop, pc and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, open or close any application, send messages etc. with verbal commands only. Some other types of Voice Assistant are:</br>
<br>•	Intelligent Personal Assistant
<br>•	Automated Personal Assistant
<br>•	Virtual Digital Assistants
<br>Nowadays AI voice assistant is very useful to human. It makes human life easier like operate PC’s or laptop on only voice command. AI voice assistant is a less time consuming. By using AI voice assistant, we save our time and contribute in other works. AI voice assistants are typically cloud-based program that requires internet connected devices. AI voice assistant is the flexibility to contract for just the services they need. For creating AI voice assistant for your computer go from basics python. AI voice assistants are task-oriented. AI voice assistant’s ability to understand and perform requests. Virtual assistants are a software that understands verbal and written commands and completes task assigned by clients. AI voice assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. There are several voice assistants in market like Siri for apple TV remote, Google Assistant for pixel XL smartphones, Alexa as a smart speaker which is developed by using Raspberry Pi. As like this all-virtual assistant we also created an AI voice assistant for windows. We use Artificial Intelligence technology for this project. Also use python as a programming language, because python offers a good major library. For this software use microphone as input device to receive voice requests from user and speaker as output device to give the output voice. This process is the combination of several different technologies like voice recognition, voice analysis and language processing. Virtual assistant uses Natural Processing language to match user text or voice input to executable commands. When a user gives a command to personal virtual assistant to perform a task, the natural language is converted the audio signals into digital signals AI voice assistant scan provide several services which includes:<br>
<br>•	Showing latest news
<br>•	Searching information on Wikipedia
<br>•	Play music, movies, etc
<br>•	Showing date-time
<br>•	Managing emails
<br>•	Open apps
<br>•	Taking photos using the computer's camera
<br>•	Writing and reading notes
